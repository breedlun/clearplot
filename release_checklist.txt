Release Checklist
=================

1. Update the version history in `doc/source/version_history.rst`.
2. Update version in `clearplot/__init__.py`, `doc/source/conf.py`, and `setup.py`.
3. Run the tests in `tests/` and examples in `doc/source/examples/run_examples.py`.  Visually verify that the tests and examples look correct.  (Eventually we could automate the verification by comparing raster images.)
4. Merge your changes with the master branch on github.
5. Tag the new version using `git tag "new_version"`.
6. Test the PyPI submission using `python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest`.
7. Download and install the package from the PyPI test server using `pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi clearplot`.  This is important to do, because the official PyPI server will not allow you to change a package in any way unless you create a new version number.
8. Upload the official PyPI submission using `python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi`.
