Release Checklist
=================

1. Update the version history in `doc/source/version_history.rst`.
2. Update version in `clearplot/__init__.py`, `doc/source/conf.py`, and `setup.py`.
3. Run the tests in `tests/` and examples in `doc/source/examples/run_examples.py`.  Visually verify that the tests and examples look correct.  (Eventually we could automate the verification by comparing raster images.)
4. Tag the new version using `git tag "new_version"`.
5. Merge your changes with the master branch on github.
6. Create a new release on github.
7. Test the PyPI submission using `python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest`.
8. Download and install the package from the PyPI test server using `pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi clearplot`.  This is important to do, because the official PyPI server will not allow you to change a package in any way unless you create a new version number.
9. Upload the official PyPI submission using `python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi`.
