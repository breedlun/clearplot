Release Checklist
=================

1. Update the version history in `doc/source/version_history.rst`.
2. Update version in `clearplot/__init__.py`, `doc/source/conf.py`, and `pyproject.toml`.
3. Run the tests in `tests/` and examples in `doc/source/examples/run_examples.py`.  Visually verify that the tests and examples look correct.  (Eventually we could automate the verification by comparing raster images.)
4. Verify the documentation builds correctly.  Execute `make html` in the `doc` directory and visually verify the html files look right.
5. Tag the new version using `git tag "new_version"`.
6. Merge your changes with the master branch on github.
7. Create a new release on github. 
8. Optional: create a virtual environment to test the PyPI submission within.  
8. Test the PyPI submission using `python -m twine upload --verbose --repository testpypi dist/*`.  This is important to do, because the official PyPI server will not allow you to change a package in any way unless you create a new version number.
9. Download and install the package from the TestPyPI test server using `pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ clearplot`.  
10. Upload the official PyPI submission using `python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi`.
