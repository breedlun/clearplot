Matplotlib does not have many fonts installed, not even Helvetica.  Follow the instructions below to manually install the provided fonts. 

Note: If a font directory has a Source_Fonts directory, the source fonts can be ignored. 

1. Find where Matplotlib stores its data.  Bring up a python interpreter.  At the prompt type the following three commands: `import matplotlib`, `matplotlib.matplotlib_fname()`, and `matplotlib.get_cachedir()`.  On a mac you should get something like: `'/Users/[username]/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc'` and `'/Users/[username]/.matplotlib'`.
2. Place the .ttf font files in: `[username]/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf/`
3. Go to `/Users/[username]/.matplotlib` and delete `fontList.cache`.  Next time matplotlib is imported the cache file will be rebuilt.
4. Install the fonts on your system so they can be accessed by other applications like Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape. 
a. For Adobe Illustrator on a Mac, you can simply open the Font Book application (`/Applications/Utilities/Font Book`) and "drag and drop" the font files into the Font Book window.
b. For Inkscape on a Mac, you must copy the font files into the main font folder, not the user font folder.  The main font folder is located at `/Library/Fonts`.
c. I do not know how to install fonts on Windows or Linux, but I am sure there are instructions online.
